I had a music library around 100k songs.
Extrack the the feature from each songs. 
Create a database to store ID3tags (ex. artist, title, gener, year ......) and feature value.
Access/college those feature values that to create the pth or npy file.
How to choose around 10k song from music library to do classifily geners ??
What is simply/easy process to do ??
May I link those with JRiver or foobar2000 ?
Music evl. comment as JMLA that stored in database.
make the LRC for each song in database.
Build REST API - Deploy as web service
Create web interface - User-friendly classification
Real-time classification - Live audio input
Multi-label classification - Multiple genres per track


Requirements for each custom genre:
- Minimum: 100 songs (more is better)
- Same format as existing data (MP3/WAV/FLAC)
- Organized in separate folders

Alternative: Two-Stage Classification
If you don't want to retrain everything:
1. Use existing model for 13 genres
2. Add a second classifier just for your 2-3 custom genres
3. Run both and combine results



> Which will be bettery,"
1. load songs extrack feature by 3 models.
2. load a batch songs extrack by 1 models, do as loop with 3 models.

> Option 2 is better - Load batch, extract with 1 model, loop through 3 models.

✅ Benefits:
- Only 1 model in memory at a time
- Better GPU memory management
- Can process in batches (e.g., 100 songs at a time)
- Can resume if interrupted
- Easier to debug

Recommended workflow:
bash
# Step 1: FMA features (2 min for 100 songs)
python3 extract_fma.py --input songs/ --output fma_features.npy

# Step 2: MERT features (30 min for 100 songs)
python3 extract_mert.py --input songs/ --output mert_features.npy

# Step 3: JMLA features (30 min for 100 songs)
python3 extract_jmla.py --input songs/ --output jmla_features.npy

# Step 4: Combine
python3 combine_features.py --output combined_features.npy


For 10k songs from your 100k library:
- Option 1: ~15-20 hours, high memory risk
- Option 2: ~12-15 hours, stable, resumable


Web UI

For 100k songs, you need:
- ✅ Search/filter capabilities
- ✅ Visual genre distribution
- ✅ Batch operations
- ✅ Export/reports
- ✅ Easy navigation
